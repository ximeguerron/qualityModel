# Product quality model for  cloud services
## 1. Metamodel of the quality model {#metaodel}
Defining the objective:
```markdown
This research aims to systematically identify and taxonomically classify 
available evidence on quality metrics for cloud services and provide a 
holistic comparison to analyze the potential limitations of existing research
```

The main research question addressed is:
```markdown
What metrics have been used to evaluate the internal and external 
quality of cloud services and how are they measured and used?
```

The resulting subquestions are: 

```markdown
•	RQ1: What quality characteristics and attributes were evaluated?

```

## 2. Method {#method}

A brief summary of cloud service metrics is shown below:

## 3. Building quality model {#building}
In this subsection, we present the list of source papers for metrics. 


## 4. Quality model for cloud services {#model}
We present a quality model for cloud services, aligned to the standard ISO/IEC 25010 SQuaRE.
The model is organized hierarchically, starting from characteristics and subcharacteristics to attributes, metrics, and
operationalizations. The section covers the cloud service domain, the classification and adaptation of characteristics
and subcharacteristics to the domain, the decomposition of quality into attributes, the determination of metrics for
attributes, and the establishment of relationships between quality entities


# Case study

## 5. Design the case study{#design}
We focus on enabling the operationalization of the quality model of cloud services and using it to assess the services. Hence, the research questions are detailed:
```markdown
• RQ1: Can the quality model be used to configure a custom quality model to assess the quality of a specific
cloud service?
• RQ2: Once quality requirements or relevant attributes are identified, can a quality model be built to fit the
business needs.?
• RQ3: Do the measurement results, their associated metrics, and operationalization provides actual knowledge
of the current state of cloud services?
• RQ4: Can the custom model be improved with new or updated metrics?
```

## 5. Taxonomy of QoS metrics for cloud services {#clasificacion}
In this subsection, is shown the taxonomy of metrics for cloud services. The classification was done using the data extraction criteria.
